How It Works:

    The whoami command returns the username associated with the current effective user ID. This is particularly useful when you're working with root privileges or in a multi-user environment, as it helps you verify which user account you're operating under.

    For example, if you are logged in as the user john but have switched to a superuser (e.g., using sudo), running whoami will show root as the username, even though you were originally logged in as john.

Use Cases:

    Identifying the Current User in Scripts:
        In shell scripts, you might want to check the user who is running the script. whoami can be used in such scripts to print or log the current username.

echo "You are logged in as: $(whoami)"

When Using sudo or su:

    If you've switched to the root user using sudo or su, running whoami will show root.

sudo su
whoami

    This will output:

        root

    In Multi-User Environments:
        In environments where you work with multiple user accounts, whoami helps confirm which user you're currently operating as, ensuring you perform the intended actions under the correct account.

Additional Help Options:

    --help
        This option provides a simple explanation of the available options and usage for the whoami command.

Conclusion:

    The whoami command is a simple but useful tool in Linux to identify the username of the currently logged-in user or the user under which the current process is running.
    It's especially useful in environments with multiple users, when switching between accounts using sudo or su, or in scripts to dynamically reference the current user.
    The command has very few options, but --help and --version are useful for getting quick information about the command's usage and version.
