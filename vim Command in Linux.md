vim Command in Linux 

The vim command is a powerful text editor used in Linux and UNIX-based systems. It is an improved version of the vi editor, offering additional features such as syntax highlighting, multi-level undo, and support for plugins. vim is commonly used for editing configuration files, writing scripts, or programming, and it is widely favored for its efficiency and versatility.
Basic Syntax:

vim [options] [file]

    options: Flags that modify the behavior of vim.
    file: The name of the file to edit. If the file does not exist, vim creates a new file.

Common Options for vim:

    -u (use a specific vimrc file)
        Specifies a custom vimrc configuration file to use instead of the default one.

vim -u custom_vimrc file.txt

    Example: Launches vim using a custom configuration file.

-y (view only)

    Opens a file in "view mode," which makes the file read-only. You cannot modify the file in this mode.

vim -y file.txt

    Example: Opens file.txt in view-only mode.

-R (read-only mode)

    Opens the file in read-only mode. You cannot save changes to the file unless you override this mode.

vim -R file.txt

    Example: Opens file.txt in read-only mode.

-b (binary mode)

    Opens the file in binary mode, which is suitable for editing non-text files such as images or compiled binaries.

vim -b file.bin

    Example: Opens file.bin in binary mode.

-c (execute a command)

    Executes a Vim command after starting the editor. This can be useful for performing a task immediately after opening a file.

vim -c "command" file.txt

    Example: Runs the :set number command to display line numbers immediately after opening file.txt.

-O (horizontal split)

    Opens multiple files in horizontal split mode (side-by-side).

vim -O file1.txt file2.txt

    Example: Opens file1.txt and file2.txt in two horizontal panes.

-o (vertical split)

    Opens multiple files in vertical split mode (one file on top and another at the bottom).

vim -o file1.txt file2.txt

    Example: Opens file1.txt and file2.txt in two vertical panes.

-n (no swap file)

    Disables the creation of a swap file when editing a file. This is useful in certain situations where you donâ€™t want vim to create backup files.

vim -n file.txt

    Example: Opens file.txt without creating a swap file.

-p (tabbed interface)

    Opens multiple files in tabs. This is similar to using a browser with multiple tabs.

vim -p file1.txt file2.txt

    Example: Opens file1.txt and file2.txt in separate tabs in vim.

-h (help)

    Displays the help page for vim with a summary of available options.

vim -h

    Example: Shows the vim help page with available command-line options.

-V (verbose)

    Runs vim in verbose mode, providing more detailed output. You can also set the verbosity level.

    vim -V1 file.txt

        Example: Runs vim with verbosity level 1, showing more information during startup.
