awk Command in Linux 

The awk command in Linux is a powerful text processing tool used for pattern scanning and processing. It is especially useful for processing structured data, such as columns in text files, logs, or CSV files. awk allows users to manipulate, extract, and transform data based on patterns and conditions. It is widely used for text-based tasks, such as filtering, sorting, and formatting output.
Basic Syntax of the awk Command:

awk 'pattern { action }' file

    pattern: A condition or pattern to match. If the pattern is true, the associated action is executed.
    action: The operation to be performed on matching lines or records (e.g., print specific fields).
    file: The file to process, or you can pipe input into awk from other commands.

Key Features of awk

    Pattern Matching: Allows you to search for specific patterns (e.g., lines containing certain text or values).
    Field-Based Processing: Processes data line by line and splits it into fields (columns), where you can manipulate individual fields.
    Built-in Variables: Provides variables like $1, $2, etc., which refer to individual fields, and $0, which refers to the entire line.

Common Uses of the awk Command:

    Print All Lines:

awk '{ print }' file.txt

    Prints every line in file.txt. Here, the action is simply print, which outputs each line.

Print Specific Field (Column):

awk '{ print $1 }' file.txt

    Prints only the first field (column) of each line in file.txt. $1 refers to the first field.

Print Multiple Fields:

awk '{ print $1, $3 }' file.txt

    Prints the first and third fields (columns) of each line.

Using a Field Separator:

    By default, awk uses whitespace (spaces or tabs) as the field separator. You can change it using the -F option.

awk -F, '{ print $1, $3 }' file.csv

    This sets the comma (,) as the field separator and prints the first and third columns from a CSV file.

Conditionally Print Lines:

awk '$2 > 50 { print $1, $2 }' file.txt

    Prints the first and second fields only if the value in the second field is greater than 50. The condition $2 > 50 is checked for each line.

Count the Number of Lines Matching a Pattern:

awk '/pattern/ { count++ } END { print count }' file.txt

    This counts how many lines contain the word pattern. The END block prints the final count after all lines have been processed.

Sum Values in a Column:

awk '{ sum += $2 } END { print sum }' file.txt

    Adds up all values in the second column and prints the total at the end.

Print Line Numbers Along with Lines:

awk '{ print NR, $0 }' file.txt

    NR is a built-in variable in awk that holds the current line number. This command prints the line number followed by the full line.

Field Formatting with printf:

awk '{ printf "%-10s %-5s\n", $1, $2 }' file.txt

    Uses printf for more precise formatting of output. Here, it prints the first field left-aligned within 10 characters and the second field left-aligned within 5 characters.

Use of BEGIN and END Blocks:

    The BEGIN block is executed before processing any lines, and the END block is executed after all lines are processed.

    awk 'BEGIN { print "Start processing" } { print $1 } END { print "Done" }' file.txt

        The output includes "Start processing" before printing the first field of each line, followed by "Done" at the end.

Special Built-in Variables in awk:

    $0: Represents the entire line (record).
    $1, $2, ...: Represents the individual fields (columns) in the line. $1 is the first field, $2 is the second, etc.
    NR: The current line number.
    NF: The number of fields in the current line.
    FS: The field separator. Default is whitespace, but you can set it to any delimiter (e.g., comma for CSV).
    RS: The record separator. Default is a newline character.
    OFS: The output field separator. Used when printing fields.
    ORS: The output record separator. Used when printing records.

Examples of awk Command with Real-Life Use Cases:

    Print the Last Field of Each Line (Using NF):

awk '{ print $NF }' file.txt

    Prints the last field of each line, regardless of how many fields are present.

Sum Values in a Column and Print Total:

awk '{ sum += $3 } END { print "Total:", sum }' file.txt

    Sums up the values in the third column and prints the total at the end.

Extract and Format Data (e.g., CSV to Tab-Delimited Format):

awk -F, '{ print $1 "\t" $2 "\t" $3 }' file.csv

    This reads a CSV file (with a comma as the field separator) and prints the columns separated by tabs.

Search for a Pattern and Print Matching Lines:

    awk '/pattern/ { print $1, $2 }' file.txt

        Prints the first and second fields of lines where the pattern pattern is found.

Help for awk Command:

Common awk Command Options:

    -F: Specifies the field separator (e.g., -F, for CSV files).
    -v: Assigns a value to a variable before execution of the script. Example: awk -v var=10 '{ print $1 + var }' file.txt.
    -f: Specifies a file containing awk program/script. Example: awk -f script.awk file.txt.
    --help: Shows a summary of the awk options.

Conclusion:

The awk command is one of the most powerful text-processing tools in Linux. It is highly versatile and can handle complex data extraction, manipulation, and reporting tasks. It works line by line and field by field, making it ideal for structured data such as logs, CSVs, or TSVs. By mastering awk, you can perform a wide range of tasks such as filtering, summarizing, and formatting text data.
