tar

The tar command in Linux is used to create and extract archive files. The name "tar" stands for tape archive, and it was originally used for writing data to magnetic tape storage, but today it is widely used to manage compressed and uncompressed archive files. The tar command can be used to combine multiple files into a single archive file or extract files from an archive.
